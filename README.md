# PluralSight Scraper
Download pluralsight videos to your local computer

This is a simple scraper code to download a whole course in one strike.
the code contains two files. a rip-prular.js file & a download.js file.

Run the rip-prular.js content inside the courseâ€™s console then it will iterate over the videos & generate a (thisCourse.json) file & download it to your pc.
now you need to copy this (thisCourse.json) file inside the download.js file. then run the download.js file from your machine.
